# Data

This folder will store the different datasets that can be used to test our proposed method (except the TCD one).

When cloning the project, this folder will be empty. However, when executing the different experiments for the first time, the MNIST and ESR datasets will be downloaded here.

Other datasets can be tested, but this implies changing some lines of codes in the src files.
